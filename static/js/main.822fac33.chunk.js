We decided that we wanted to make something which was doable in real life but also in a virtual environment. We made a changing sportsfield in minecraft which could, if we had the funds, be implemented in real life. We wanted to place lights and sensors in the ground so you could step on a sensor and the lights would change into a pattern of i.e. a basketball field. And when you left the field would reset and you could stand on the sensor for it to change into a footballfield.
