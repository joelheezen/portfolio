I had no idea how to code, apart from a simple if else statement. This robot made me learn the basics of programming faster than I could've imagined. Uni told me to use the programming blocks to put code together like that, but when I looked at the code it all started making sense and I wanted to make this robot my own and program it by myself and not with the help of any drag and dropping.\" imgLink=\"https://stud.hosted.hr.nl/0898841/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/48ff17be-d55a-473e-ae02-7b0b8d79d22b-1024x1024.jpg\" secondP=\"The goal of this robot was to beat the rest of the robots made by the other students. Mine actually won the finals because of a little cheat. I placed my robot slightly sideways as the other robot could only go straight. Since the front of my robot was now at a slight angle, the other robot would drive into it and fall off of the table. My robot was equipped with a stabbing weapon which actually punctured someone else's robot.\"/>\n      <Article title=\"Reservation system\" subtext=\"I made a website so you can book an appointment with your accountant.\" firstP=\"unfortunately I lost most of the pictures/code from this project. Pandemic made it so I had to switch workspaces and forgot to back up this project.\" imgLink=\"\" secondP=\"I used PHP and SQL to make the backend and then html js and css for the frontend. It was meant for it to be so you could book a timeslot with an accountant, you could select timeslots of 15-30 minutes and then see in the agenda which slots were open. This website also had an admin area in which the accountant could log in and see all appointments in an easy way and also make changes to those. Also they could fill in days in which they were out of office.\"/>\n      <Article title=\"Creative playing field(concept)\" subtext=\"Made a creative playing field in Minecraft since we couldn't meet in person.\" firstP=\"We got tasked with solving a problem in a neighbourhood in Rotterdam. What the problem was we didn't know at the time yet. We had to do some research about what we should fix. In the end we wanted to do something for juveniles because they seemed bored in that area. But we decided on something more nature friendly.\" imgLink=\"https://stud.hosted.hr.nl/0898841/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-08_09.42.19-1024x407.png\" secondP=\"Then the pandemic struck so we had to go back to our original idea since we couldn't be outside do make something for the plants in that neighbourhood. We decided that we wanted to make something which was doable in real life but also in a virtual environment. We made a changing sportsfield in minecraft which could, if we had the funds, be implemented in real life. We wanted to place lights and sensors in the ground so you could step on a sensor and the lights would change into a pattern of i.e. a basketball field. And when you left the field would reset and you could stand on the sensor for it to change into a footballfield. \"/>\n      <Article title=\"Tacitcal unicorns\" subtext=\"My first game, made entirely in typescript.\" firstP=\"This project has been one of the most fun things I've done at school. We lost a lot of our previous group so we were tasked to make a game with just the 3 of us. While the rest of the groups were about 5-6 people big. I think we were better off with just 3 people since the communication was way better that way.\" imgLink=\"https://stud.hosted.hr.nl/0898841/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unknown.png\" secondP=\"We made a game based on a random generator we got from school. We got searching, unicorns and fantasy. So naturally we made a game in which you have to find you unicorn friends who have been taken by an evil wizard. This game was so well received I actually got a job over the summer to make a introduction game for all the hogeschool rotterdam freshmen.\"/>\n      <Article title=\"introgame for Hogeschool Rotterdam\" subtext=\"I got hired to make a welcoming experience for freshmen.\" firstP=\"after seeing my game 'tactical unicorn' we got a message saying they wanted to make a game for freshmen to play since they can't physically go to school. We did exactly that!\" imgLink=\"https://i.imgur.com/RNTNHfJ.jpg\" secondP=\"The game taught everything you need to know as a newcommer to hogeschool rotterdam. i.e. how to get counseling and where to find it. How the online school system works. How to find your schedule. All of that stuff was explained in the game with several puzzles to get further into the game. We also held a competition in which the winner could get a sweater with their teamname in the game. So they get some bragging rights if they were the fastest in their class.\"/>\n      <Article title=\"Newsradar\" subtext=\"Designed and made an app for a dutch newsoutlet, specifically to appeal to the younger generation.\" firstP=\"My group and I had to figure out how to get the younger generation interested in local news. This was quite a hard task since most local new is kind of trivial. So how could we exactly make the news headline 'cat got rescued from a tree' exciting?\" imgLink=\"https://i.imgur.com/zle5aFD.png\" secondP=\"The app we made takes all the news-articles they publish from an API and places them in our map of the area. All stories have a location tag but nothing is done with it. So we decided to use those tags to make the news hit closer to home. You would get a radius which you can make larger or smaller depending on your preference, and within that radius you could see all stories close to you.\"/>\n      <Article title=\"Untitled unity game(ongoing)\" subtext=\"Teaching myself new languages and a new engine while also having fun making a game.\" firstP=\"I've been interested in game development since I started gaming basically. And now since I have the background knowledge I can start my own projects. Where this game is going is still unknown, but I'm adding features whenever I get a new idea. So far my general idea would be a roguelike first person shooter.\" imgLink=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZyHJZhp.png\" secondP=\"I've made a gun which can shoot fast/slow and everything in between. Damage system is also somewhat in place and movement is as good as finished. I'm having way more fun coding this than I thought I would have. \"/>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
